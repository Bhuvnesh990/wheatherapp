### **Objective:**

To build a dynamic weather application that provides real-time weather updates based on the user’s location or input. The app fetches and displays data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions using external APIs, offering a user-friendly interface for quick weather checks.

### **Key Activities:**

1. **API Integration**  
   Integrated a third-party weather API to fetch real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions based on the user's input or current location.

2. **Responsive Web Design**  
   Designed the app to work seamlessly across various devices, ensuring an optimal user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

3. **User Interaction**  
   Implemented interactive features using JavaScript, allowing users to input their city or use geolocation to get current weather updates instantly.

4. **Error Handling**  
   Added error handling for cases where the API fails to fetch data or when a user enters an invalid location, providing helpful feedback to the user.

5. **Data Display**  
   Visualized the weather data effectively using icons and clean typography, making it easy for users to quickly understand the current conditions.

### **Technologies Used:**

1. **HTML5:**  
   Structured the app’s content, including forms for input and sections for displaying weather data.

2. **CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid):**  
   Styled the weather app, ensuring it remains responsive and visually appealing on different screen sizes. Used Flexbox and Grid for layout management.

3. **JavaScript (ES6+):**  
   Handled fetching data from the weather API and dynamically updating the DOM to display the current weather. Managed user inputs and interactions, including city search and geolocation.

4. **Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap):**  
   Fetched real-time weather data from a third-party weather API, processed the response, and displayed temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions on the app.

5. **Font Awesome:**  
   Used for adding icons that visually represent weather conditions (e.g., sun, rain, clouds) and enhance UI aesthetics.

6. **Geolocation API:**  
   Utilized the browser’s Geolocation API to provide users with the option to get weather data for their current location without manually inputting their city.

7. **GitHub Pages (optional):**  
   If hosted on GitHub, mention GitHub Pages for deployment, and using version control to manage development and updates.
